# You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an
# appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a Walk
# Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing
# directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk only a single block for each letter (direction) and you know it
# takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will
# take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point.
# Return false otherwise.

# Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only).
# It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).
